# Challenge1_Bootcamp- Accessiblity Challenge

# Description of Project
 The purpose of this project is to improve upon existing code by refactoring, increasing accessibility, and increasing readability.
 The stylesheet and existing HTML code were edited in order to make it easier for those who come behind to read and better understand the code. 

 ## List of Changes
 [HTML]
 * Creating a short yet descriptive title for the page
 * Linking all <img> elements appropriately 
 * Creating working links using <a> element
 * Replacing unnecessary <div> elements with semantic elements like <nav>, <aside>, <header>, and <footer>
 * Replacing excessive class IDs with targeted element selectors 
 * Ensuring appropriate spacing to increase readability
 * Adding alt tags to <img> elements

 [CSS]
 * Listing elements in the order in which they appear in the stylesheet for better readability
 * Condensing element classes that have the same properties
 * Changing colors as needed for better contrast 
 * Removing redundant elements 
 * Commenting changes within the stylesheet so that other coders can acknowledge changes
